# Property-Review-Web-App

The StudentNest is a property review website which allows authenticated students to leave reviews and conducts user data analysis using Python, together with Django, jQuery and Materialize CSS.

You can also find it deployed on Heroku at http://studentnest.herokuapp.com/studentnest

For now, you can only search by "Pittsburgh" and "New York " as they are the only sample data I have created.

Please note if you would like to log in as a student, you will need to register using an email address ending with .edu. Then I will activate your account from my computer before you can successfully log in.
